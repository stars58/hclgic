If you have ASH, you can use it to find the sessions and queries that waited the most for “log file sync” event. 
I found that this has some correlation with the worse redo generators.

-- find the sessions and queries causing most redo and when it happened

select SESSION_ID,user_id,sql_id,round(sample_time,'hh'),count(*) from V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY
where event like 'log file sync'
group by  SESSION_ID,user_id,sql_id,round(sample_time,'hh')
order by count(*) desc


08 -- you can look the the SQL itself by:  

select * from DBA_HIST_SQLTEXT  
where sql_id='dwbbdanhf7p4a'

SELECT dhso.object_name,
 sum(db_block_changes_delta)
 FROM dba_hist_seg_stat dhss,
 dba_hist_seg_stat_obj dhso,
 dba_hist_snapshot dhs
 WHERE dhs.snap_id = dhss.snap_id
 AND dhs.instance_number = dhss.instance_number
 AND dhss.obj# = dhso.obj#
 AND dhss.dataobj# = dhso.dataobj#
 AND begin_interval_time BETWEEN to_date(’2012_09_07 14',’YYYY_MM_DD HH24') AND to_date(’2012_09_07 15',’YYYY_MM_DD HH24')
 GROUP BY dhso.object_name
 order by sum(db_block_changes_delta) desc



SELECT distinct dbms_lob.substr(sql_text,4000,1),
 FROM dba_hist_sqlstat dhss,
 dba_hist_snapshot dhs,
 dba_hist_sqltext dhst
 WHERE upper(dhst.sql_text) LIKE ‘%INT_UPLOAD_STATUS%’
AND dhss.snap_id=dhs.snap_id
 AND dhss.instance_Number=dhs.instance_number
 AND dhss.sql_id = dhst.sql_id and rownum<2;


SELECT s.sid, s.serial#, s.username, s.program,
           i.block_changes
           FROM v$session s, v$sess_io i
           WHERE s.sid = i.sid
           ORDER BY 5 , 1, 2, 3, 4;
